Linear Search
Time Complexity: O(n)
Best Case O(1): The target element is the very first element 
in the list. The algorithm finds it immediately in one step.
Average/Worst Case O(n):
Average: The target is somewhere in the middle.
Worst: The target element is the very last element, or the 
target is not in the list at all. The algorithm must check 
all n elements.

Space Complexity: O(1)
It only requires a fixed, small amount of extra memory to 
store loop variables (like the index i), regardless of the 
size of the input list n.

Binary Search 
Time Complexity: O(log n)
Best Case O(1): The target element is found on the first 
comparison (it's the middle element).
Average/Worst Case O(log n):In the worst case, the algorithm 
eliminates half of the remaining elements in each step.6 The 
number of steps required to narrow down a list of size n is 
log base 2 n. This makes it much faster than linear search 
for large lists.

Space Complexity:O(1)
Binary Search can be implemented iteratively (using a loop) 
or recursively.Iterative: Uses a fixed amount of extra space 
for pointers (low, high, mid), resulting in O(1) space 
complexity.Recursive: While still very efficient, the 
recursive calls use the call stack, which can lead to O(log 
n) space complexity in the worst case, though O(1) is 
generally cited for the iterative implementation.
