Differences between Stacks and Queues

Principle - LIFO (Last In, First Out) (Stacks), while FIFO (First In, First Out) (Queues).

2. Main Operations --Push(Insertion) and Pop (Removal) (Stacks) while, Enqueue (Insertion) and Dequeue (Removal) (Queues).

3. Access Point-- Both insertion and removal occur at the Top of the structure (Stacks) while Insertion occurs at the Rear/Tail. Removal occurs at the Front/Head.(Queues)

4. Pointers/Indices --Typically only needs one pointer to track the Top element (Stacks) while, Requires two pointers (Front and Rear) to manage both ends.(Queues)
5. Analogy-- A stack of trays in a cafeteria (the last tray placed on top is the first one taken)(Stacks). A line of customers at a bank (the first person in line is the first one served).(Queues)

Time Complexity of both

The time complexity for the core operations (insertion and removal) in both Stacks and Queues is O(1) (Constant Time), then for search and access O(n) for both.
